Capstone - JH Data Science project

## The purpose of this project is to create an app that predicts text.  The data that the app is based on is from a corpus called HC Corpora (www.corpora.heliohost.org). 

## See the readme file at http://www.corpora.heliohost.org/aboutcorpus.html for details on the corpora available.

The HC Corpora dataset is comprised of the output of crawls of news sites, blogs and twitter.  The dataset contains 3 files across four languages (Russian, Finnish, German and English). This project will focus on the English language datasets. The names of the data files are as follows:

1. en_US.blogs.txt
2. en_US.twitter.txt
3. en_US.news.txt
